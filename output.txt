I have updated the `specs/002-python-cli-todo-app/spec.md` file with your choices for the clarification questions.

The specification for the Python CLI Todo App is now complete and validated.

**Branch Name**: `002-python-cli-todo-app`
**Spec File Path**: `specs/002-python-cli-todo-app/spec.md`
**Checklist File Path**: `specs/002-python-cli-todo-app/checklists/requirements.md`

The next step is to use the `/sp.plan` command to create a technical plan based on this specification.
