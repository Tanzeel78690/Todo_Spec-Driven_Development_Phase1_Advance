Project: CLI-based In-Memory Todo Application (Spec-driven, Agentic) Target audience: - Beginners learning agentic development - Evaluators reviewing spec-driven workflows using Gemini CLI + SpecKitPlus Objective: Define a complete, unambiguous specification for a Python CLI Todo app that can be fully implemented by an AI agent without manual coding. Functional requirements: Basic Level (MVP): - Add Task: title, optional description - View Tasks: list all tasks with ID and completion status - Update Task: modify title and/or description by ID - Delete Task: remove task by ID - Mark Complete: toggle completed/incomplete state Intermediate Level: - Priorities: high / medium / low - Tags/Categories: assign multiple labels - Search: keyword-based search (title/description) - Filter: by status, priority, or tag - Sort: by priority or alphabetical order Advanced Level: - Recurring Tasks: daily/weekly recurrence logic - Due Dates: optional date/time per task - Reminders: console-based time alerts (no background services) Non-functional requirements: - Language: Python 3.13+ - Runtime: CLI (menu-driven) - Storage: in-memory only - Dependencies: Python standard library only - Architecture: modular, readable, single-responsibility functions - Error handling: graceful handling of invalid input Constraints: - No persistence between runs - No external libraries - No GUI or web components - No implementation details (what, not how) Output expectations: - Clear task data model definition - Explicit command/menu behavior - Defined edge cases and validation rules - Specification sufficient to generate /sp.plan and /sp.tasks Success criteria: - All features testable via CLI in one session - Zero ambiguity for agent implementation - Fully aligned with /sp.constitution - Suitable for automated evaluation via SpecKitPlus
