# Implementation Plan: Core Todo Application Features

**Branch**: `001-core-todo-features` | **Date**: 2025-12-25 | **Spec**: [spec.md](./spec.md)
**Input**: Feature specification from `specs/001-core-todo-features/spec.md`

## Summary

This plan outlines the technical approach for building a command-line, in-memory todo application. The implementation will be generated by an AI agent (Claude Code) based on this plan and its corresponding tasks, strictly adhering to the project constitution and the feature specification. The goal is to produce a clean, simple, and reproducible Python application without any manual coding.

## Technical Context
<!--
  ACTION REQUIRED: Replace the content in this section with the technical details
  for the project. The structure here is presented in advisory capacity to guide
  the iteration process.
-->

**Language/Version**: Python 3.13+
**Primary Dependencies**: Python Standard Library only
**Storage**: In-memory Python data structures (e.g., a list of dictionaries)
**Testing**: [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Proposing `pytest` as the test runner, pending research.]
**Target Platform**: WSL 2 (Ubuntu 22.04)
**Project Type**: Single project (CLI Application)
**Performance Goals**: N/A (not relevant for a simple CLI application)
**Constraints**: Must run on the specified platform; all data is ephemeral.
**Scale/Scope**: Single-user, command-line application with 5 core features.

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

- **[x] I. Spec-Driven Development**: This plan is derived directly from the `spec.md` file.
- **[x] II. Process over Manual Coding**: The plan is designed to be executed by an AI agent, not a human developer.
- **[x] III. Clarity & Simplicity**: The proposed structure uses simple, single-responsibility modules and standard Python features.
- **[x] IV. Reproducibility**: The plan specifies a standard Python project structure that can be easily set up and run.
- **[x] V. Clean Code Discipline**: The proposed module separation enforces separation of concerns from the start.

├── __main__.py   # Main entry point, starts the application loop
├── app.py        # Core application logic, main menu, and control flow
├── tasks.py      # Handles all data management for tasks (add, view, update, delete)
├── cli.py        # Handles all command-line input and output formatting
└── utils.py      # Helper functions (e.g., ID generation, input parsing)

tests/

└── unit/

    └── test_cli.py      # Unit tests for the cli module
```

**Structure Decision**: A single project structure is chosen for its simplicity, which is a core principle of the constitution. This flat structure is easy to navigate for a small application and clearly separates concerns: `app.py` for control flow, `tasks.py` for data logic, and `cli.py` for presentation.
